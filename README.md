## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Animations

### What I learned

SVGs are the bane of my existence .

### Continued development

Javascript, SVGs, and animation. Still inexperienced with all three.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65518581/how-do-i-make-only-one-accordion-open-at-a-time) - This helped me with the script that closes all accordions currently not active. I could not find a solution to this by myself.
- [Animista](https://animista.net/) - This website helped me understand animations a little bit better. Started with the basic animation and tweaked it to make them animate more smoothly.
